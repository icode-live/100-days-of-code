### Day 01: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Starting with a C to Rust porting activity, to better understand the language.
2. Doing the freecodecamp challenges for the sake of completeness.

**Thoughts**: Something is missing from the Rust documentation eco-system. A simple plain vanilla
*this is how you **X** in rust*. Perhaps this repo will contribut with that end in mind.

**Link to work**: 
1. c_to_rust [Git repo](https://github.com/icode-live/c_to_rust)
2. freecodecamp up to html5/css [Ordered list](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/create-an-ordered-list)
